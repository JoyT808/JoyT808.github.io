Finding Duplicates is code that I made in ICS 141 : Discrete Mathematics 1.
It is coded in python and completed within about a week.

In this project, I learned more about BigO and time complexity. The task for the assignment was not only to find the duplicate numbers but to do so with a time complexity of O(n).

Here is the code for Finding Duplicates.
