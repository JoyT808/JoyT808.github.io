Binary Addition is a program that adds binary numbers together. It was for ICS 141 : Discrete Mathematics 1 and it is coded in Python and created in JupyterLab.

 My role in this assignment was to completely implement the program.

In this project, I learned more about what binary numbers, how to translate decimal into binary numbers, and finally how to add binary numbers together.
