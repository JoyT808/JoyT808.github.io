Binary Addition is a program that adds binary numbers together that I created in ICS 141 : Discrete Mathematics 1.
It is coded in python and completed within a week.

In this project, I learned more about what binary numbers, how to translate decimal into binary numbers, and finally how to add binary numbers together. 

Here is the code for Binary Addition.
