From my initial introduction to computer science in high school to the present, I have delved into different coding languages. I first started with Python and JavaScript, and I expanded to be more proficient in Java. 

Recently, I've gotten the opportunity to learn and review more of JavaScript. Although I have previously coded in JavaScript before, it was never in depth and the bare minimum required for basic web development in high school. I was recently assigned to complete approximately 140 JavaScript related questions on FreeCodeCamp and so far, I found working with JavaScript to be a much straightforward and enjoyable experience compared to Java. A few things I have learnt how to do is using arrow functions, destructuring assignments, and using switch code. Arrow functions help improve code readability by offering a concise way to write functions. Destructuring assignments too provides code readability and doing so by assigning values taken directly from an object. Switch code is something I'm very excited to use more of because of how easier and neat it looks compared to using if statements for multiple specific conditions. Something that I like about JavaScript is that it's not required to declare the specific variable data types that Java requires and its syntax is simple and aligns more closely to python.
  
As Iâ€™m still a beginner in computer science and coding, I can not quite say whether or not JavaScript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective. However, I do know that there are some advantages to knowing how to code in JavaScript especially since its used in web development which is something I'm very interested in as well.

Something new that I've learnt about is the concept: athletic software engineering. It consists of doing Workout of the Day (WOD) which are problem that needs to be solved as efficently as possible while also being time-constrained. Although it's very stressful for me, I find it quite enjoyable when I successfully accomplished the task under the time limit. Its a good motivation for me to catch up with my peeres as well as learning different approaches and methods a problem could be solved.
