<h2 id="what-are-smart-questions">What Are Smart Questions?</h2>
<p>Asking questions is significant in learning and personal growth. It can show engagement in a topic and encourages critical thinking and being able to analyze information. However, in a professional aspect or even in general, when asking a respected peer a question, it’s important to be able to formulate smart questions in order to not appear as lazy, arrogant, or stupid.</p>

<p>According to Eric Raymond, in his article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, you should always do research beforehand such as searching online, reading the sources that are provided/available to you or searching in forums to see if the questions have been asked already. This demonstrates the commitment of your efforts when seeking answers. Another important aspect to consider is formulating good critical questions and demonstrating in an attempt to solve it as well as providing specific detail and background regarding the question. Lastly, it is always important to be respectful and polite especially when you’re asking for help and people are taking part of their time to answer and explain for you.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-smart-and-not-smart-questions">Examples of Smart and not Smart Questions</h2>
<p>A helpful community to ask questions for programming related questions is on <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/">Stack Overflow</a>. Stack Overflow has millions of users and its community has helped about 50 billion developers already. As expected, it also receives a lot of questions everyday as well and there are a variety of different questions.</p>

<h3 id="smart-question">Smart Question</h3>
<p>An example of a smart question I found on Stack Overflow was posted around March 22nd, 2017. It was asking what the most efficient way to clone a JavaScript object. What I believe makes it a smart question is their specific attempts on solving the problem as well as their results or what their thought process was. An example that demonstrates that is when they said</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve seen obj = eval(uneval(o)); being used, but that’s non-standard and only supported by Firefox”.</p>

  <p>It shows they did further research as well as the specific reasoning that one of the possible solutions was not viable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="not-smart-question">Not Smart Question</h3>
<p>An example of a not so smart question I found was posted quite recently on September 5th, 2023. It was asking how to remove a green wavy underline in Visual Studio. Although their question sort of shows they did some research on how, they lack clarity on what suggestions they already tried. Another thing I’ve noticed about is that they had a somewhat demanding tone as well as various informal language and grammatical errors. The part that explicitly show their negative tone and grammatical errors the most is the last sentence that says</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” So i hope someone have a solution”.</p>

  <p>The “i” isn’t capitalized, “have” should’ve been replaced with has, and again they have a demanding and impatient tone.</p>
</blockquote>
