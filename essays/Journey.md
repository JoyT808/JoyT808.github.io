As a Computer Science major at University of Hawaii at Manoa, my journey into software engineering has been both challenging and fascinating. This field is immensely much more complex than I’ve imagined and I’m exhilarated to develop and hone my skills and gain more experience. 

My passion and interest for computer science first developed in high school, where I was first introduced to it in an elective course. It introduced me to a variety of applications that are beneficial or required to know how to code such as app development, game design, and web development. I was quickly shown how frustrating and difficult coding could be, however, the challenging complex puzzles and how there were various solutions and approaches was something that captivated me in wanting to improve and learn more about it. 


As I advance further in the field of software engineering, I’ve begun developing more skills such as proficiency in programming languages, algorithmic thinking and being able to collaborate with others.

One of the main skills to develop is proficiency in programming languages. Through the courses offered at my university as well as online resources, I have grown more confident and familiar with Python, JavaScript and Java and I plan to further expand by learning C and C++ next. Learning how to read and write different coding languages will help enable me to be able to take diverse projects and be more versatile in the future.

Algorithmic and critical thinking is being able to understand algorithms and data structures and being able to create an efficient solution that can be replicated again. It is significant to be able to create and optimize code and I aspire and look forward to taking more time to hone this skill the most throughout my career. I plan to do so by practicing writing solutions to problems as optimized and efficient as possible while being time-contrainted, Furthermore, I’ll review and learn from examples and resources available online.

Another important skill that I’m starting to develop is being able to collaborate with my peers. Practicing this skill is immensely beneficial because it’s important to be able to communicate ideas as well as listening and understanding others' ideas and point of view. It helps expand my perspective as well as being able to build on each other's ideas to come to a solution.


To conclude, my interest in software engineering is not merely a career choice but also a passion that I want to expand on. An aspiration I have is being able to apply it to other interests and hobbies such as graphic design, digital art, and games. By steadily improving my skills in proficiency in programming, algorithmic & critical thinking, and the ability to collaborate with others, I aim to steadily further expand my knowledge, achieve my aspirations, and as well as build more confidence to be able to conquer the challenges that lie in my path.
