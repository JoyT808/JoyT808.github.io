## Purpose of a UI?
The purpose of a user interface (UI), is for users to be able to interact with software systems and programs. It contains a lot of elements such as graphical elements like buttons, links, images, text, and other visuals to help inform, collect their input, or/and help navigate the user to use the application. Having a good and user-friendly UI is important since it contributes to users wanting to interact with it, increasing engagement and retention.

## Experience with Web Development
To create a website, it usually uses Hypertext Markup Languages (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. HTML is used to define the graphical elements (text, images, ect) and it provides the structure and content. CSS on the other hand is to style the elements in the HTML file such as changing fonts, size, and color. Lastly, javascript is the main programming language used for websites, and it's used to add interactive features.

Although we have not utilized javascript into websites yet, we learned how to use HTML and CSS. At first, I found it a bit overwhelming. Creating a website was a lot more complicated than I expected and I found myself struggling with positioning, sizing of elements and learning all the different attributes and formatting. 

One of the first thing I made was a page that explained about the history of browsers. In that assignment I learned basic HTML such as inserting links, and formatting by using tags like 'div', 'p', and 'img' and enclosing them with angle brackets.

## Experience with Bootstrap 5
Later on, we were introduced to Bootstrap 5 which I found even more difficult to learn at first. The Bootstrap5 documents mainly provided examples and did not elaborate on what each attribute did. Most of the learning came from experimenting and testing however once I got the hang of it, it eventually helped accelerate the development process. Bootstrap 5 contains vast amounts of powerful and useful features that help organize and develop a responsive website a bit more easily. It includes helpful layout elements such as containers, row, and column that help with margin and padding as well as implementing a button or add other style customization without needing to use css to style as much.

One of the mini project that I created using Bootstrap 5 was replicating a website. To create the website I used Bootstrap 5's navbar, drop down, buttons, and containers.
