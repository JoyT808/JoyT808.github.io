## Purpose of a UI?
The purpose of a user interface (UI), is for users to be able to interact with software systems and programs. It contains a lot of elements such as graphical elements like buttons, links, images, text, and other visuals to help inform, collect their input, or/and help navigate the user to use the application. Having a good and user-friendly UI is important since it contributes to users wanting to interact with it, increasing engagement and retention.

## My Experience with Bootstrap 5
Only recently have I started learning how to implement a UI framework and I found it a bit overwhelming. Creating a website is a lot more complicated than I expected and I found myself struggling with positioning and sizing of elements at first. However, we were then introduced to Bootstrap 5 which although was also difficult to learn at first, but eventually helped accelerate the development process. Bootstrap 5 contains powerful and useful features that help organize and develop a responsive website a bit more easily. It includes layout elements such as containers, row, and column that help with margin and padding as well as implementing a button or add other style customization without needing to use css to style as much.
